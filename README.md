# WordCloudPRAW
  prawword.py scrapes all of the comments from a reddit thread using PRAW, then creates a word cloud using the WordCloud library. </br>

  The word cloud is shaped by whatever mask you choose to overlay it with, so I suggest using a larger image as a mask. Otherwise, the wordcloud might come out looking very blurry. </br>
